           This website is new (2/1/2026) and is home to my ramblings on technology, society, nature and beyond. I have sought from a young age to understand why the world is the way it is and write about what I find. That curiousity led me to studying computers, specifically software development, which subsequently led to a comfortable career. Now, in my spare time, I seek to understand the world in ways other than zero's and one's. I hope that something I do here leaves a positive impact. This is my legacy.

       <h2>Who am I?</h2>

       <div>
           I am currently twenty-nine years of age and I live in Portland, Oregon, originally from Macon, Georgia. I'm a software engineer professionally and have been for the last eleven years. My favorite hobbies outside of coding and writing are riding my motorcycle (04 sportster, 8" over forks, rabbit ear handlebars, sh*t chopper), picking up trash around my neighborhood and listening to (and sometimes making) music. I currently consider myself a libertarian socialist and a lot of what I write about and do outside of work is oftentimes related to informing others of those ideas.
